Database
The database saves all compressed input for potential future use and comparison.

Parser
The parser takes the data from the input modules and combines it into useful information, essentially the 8 wastes of Lean and actual productive work.
Defects and Extra processing - Measured in number of andon and moves from the cell during work
Overproduction and Inventory - Measured by size of WIP and storage
Waiting - TBD (data is there, just harder to parse)
Movement and transport - Time workers spend away from station
Unused talent - Measured in total time wasted
